*   Programmer: Ibrahim Johar Farooqi (23K-0074)
*   Date: 4 March 2024
*   Description: Write a program that uses composition to implement a game engine. A game engine is madeup of several components.
*                    For example:
*                    a) Graphics rendering engine
*                    b) Input handler
*                    c) Physics engine
*                    You donâ€™t have to write the logic for how these individual components work.
